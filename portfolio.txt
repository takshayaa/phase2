                        -----------------------Amazing portfolio------------------
						
						
	Tools used:
		VSCode
		Angular
		Github
		
		
	As per the requirements,
		I have developed an amazing portfolio.
		In this I have used 3 components namely,
			1)Header
			2)Sign-in
			3)Sign-Up
		When we start the local server by default sign-in page will open.In that I have made validation for the input form.
		If the user register he has to sign-in using the credentials(email-id and password),if the user gives the wrong credentials it'll show the pop-up message as wrong credentials on the top of the sign-in card.
		If the user has not registered he has to sign-up using sign-up button
		In sign-up page I have made validation for all the input page.
		Once the user registers ,it'll show a pop-up message as "Registered successfully".
		After that it will take the sign-in page,and user has to login using his credentials.
		Once the user sign-in,it'll shows the all the details of the user with the message "You are signed in successfully".
